      <h1>Bio(F.Y.I)</h1>
        <p>
          I used to study I.T and Business management a decade ago till tough
          times hit and i couldnt finish, years have gone by and i discovered my
          passion of <strong>food</strong>and knack for <em>music production</em>
          One thing however has remained resonant in my world that Technological
          prowess is a skill or tool worth having and one that can be used
          flexibly, creatively and uniquely to fit <strong>my lifestyle</strong>
          of choice and help be the backbone to my future diverse endeavors
          which will always be integrated with tech. So im back to finish my
          tech or rather continue of this never ending tech roller-coaster
